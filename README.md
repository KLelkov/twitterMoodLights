# twitterMoodLights
This is the code for my custom made lamp - Twitter Mood Light.
It analyses the tweets in your area for the past hour and changes color based on the mood detected.

## Notes
Dont forget to enter your wifi settings in twitterProject.ino and sdCard.ino

Also, you need to get your bearer token from twitter API and insert it in twitterWebsite.ino
